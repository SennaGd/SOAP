# Soap Info
__ Senna's Optimization Automated Program __

__SOAP__ is an optimization/automation program, that helps people optimize their Windows systems on first install. 
This program will allow you to debloat your windows as an example: Disabling Copilot, removing unnecessary apps that the user does not use.
The program also allows users to enable some registry tweaks, this ensures the experience of the user will be smooth and snappy.

## You might ask "Why?"
When I was younger I used to play rhythm games, this meant that each milisecond of input latency mattered.
Now I still play those games but I also love to program which i do most of my time now.
After doing years of research on input latency I noticed how big of a change it had on my experience.
So before my school even started I set my ways to learn __Python__ Which is an really easy programming language.
With this I started creating __SOAP__ in a '.bat' file. This was all really fun and simple but I found that I did not like to create it,
purely due to the sheer amount of lines the program had without even being 10% done. 
So I switched to python using a library called "Tkinter" and "Customtkinter", with this I created a lot of different versions of __SOAP__.
In my development I wanted to make the program as easy to add new tweaks and application downloads, this is where I created a translator in __Javascript__, to ensure me that I could have an easy time adding the tweaks. But unfortunately it wasn't enough. So I remade __SOAP__ like 3 times after that and came to the conclution I should've just used a multidimensional array. Which the latest version uses.

This project is far from done, but for the Python versions it is done.
Moving forward I will learn myself some C/C++ to create a better version of soap that is also not 50MB big.
